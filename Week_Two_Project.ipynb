    "### Garbage Collection\n",
    "- Lack of effective memory management leads to slow performance of applications, unexpected crashes, and even memory leaks.\n",
    "- **Garbage Collection** is a memory management technique used in programming languages to automatically free up memory that is no longer accessible or in use by the application. It helps prevent memory leaks, optimize memory usage, and ensure efficient memory allocation for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is garbage collection necessary?\n",
    "- When writing code, we create objects that store data, perform calculations, or even manage tasks. However, the objects continue to occupy memory space when they have served their purpose, unless they are explicitly removed.\n",
    "- When these objects that are not used accumulate in your code, they cause your application to use more memory than necessary, slowing down the performance of your application.\n",
    "- Garbage collection automatically detects when objects are no longer needed and  safely removes them from memory. This helps:-\n",
    "    - **Prevent memory leaks** - Automatically removes unused objects from memory reducing the risk of leaks (unreleased memory no longer needed)\n",
    "    - **Simplify the process of writing code** - Python automatically handles memory management and hence you can focus on writing code rather than worring about memory management.\n",
    "    - **Optimize performance** - Freeing up memory helps maintain the performance of your application especially in programs that handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Python handles memory management\n",
    "- At the very primary level, Python uses two different memory management techniques to implement garbage collection, they are: *reference counting* and *generational garbage collection*.\n",
    "- The two methods help to ensure that memory is managed properly and minimise the cahnces of memory leaks and optimizes your application performance.\n",
    "#### 1. **Reference counting**\n",
    "This is a fundamental method used to manage memory in Python. It involves keeping track of the number of references to an object in memory. Every time a new reference to an object is created, Python will increase the reference count of that object. Similarly, when a reference is removed, Python will decrease the reference count.\n",
    "- Tracking References: Every object in Python has a reference count, which is updated whenever the object is referenced or dereferenced. For instance, assigning an object to a variable or passing it to a function increases its reference count, while deleting the variable decreases the count.\n",
    "- Deallocating Memory: When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, meaning no part of your code is using the object, Python automatically deallocates the memory it occupies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this method of reference counting has limitations. It doesn't have the ability to handle cyclic references, that occur when two or more objects reference one another forming a cycle. In such cases, references counts never reach zero thus preventing memory from being reclaimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Generational garbage collection**\n",
    "This method overcomes the limitations of reference counting. It is designed to handle cyclic references, that occur when two or more objects reference one another, improving the memory management efficiency. The idea is that most objects are short-lived(i.e. temporary objects), or long-lived(i.e. persistent objects) and this categorisation of objects by age helps optimize Python's garbage collection performance.\n",
    "- *Generations* Pythonâ€™s garbage collector organizes objects into three generations: Generation 0 (youngest), Generation 1 (middle-aged), and Generation 2 (oldest). New objects are placed in Generation 0, and if they survive garbage collection, they move to the next generation.\n",
    "- *Prioritizing Younger Objects* - The garbage collector runs more frequently on younger objects (Generation 0) because these objects are more likely to become unused quickly. As objects age and are moved to higher generations, they are collected less frequently. This approach reduces the overhead of garbage collection by focusing more on objects that are likely to be discarded soon.\n",
    "- *Handling Cyclic References* - Generational garbage collection is particularly effective at identifying and collecting objects involved in cyclic references. During the collection process, Pythonâ€™s garbage collector can detect these cycles and reclaim the memory, preventing memory leaks caused by cyclic references."

    "### Key Differences Between NumPy arrays and Python lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Data Type Homogeneity* - NumPy arrays can only store elements of the same data type (e.g., all integers or all floats), while Python lists can hold elements of different types (e.g., integers, strings, etc.).\n",
    "- *Performance* - NumPy arrays are more efficient and faster for numerical computations due to contiguous memory allocation and the use of vectorized operations.\n",
    "- *Size* - NumPy arrays consume less memory compared to Python lists.\n",
    "- *Functionality* - NumPy provides a wide range of functions optimized for mathematical operations, such as matrix manipulations, linear algebra, and random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of NumPy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Speed* - NumPy arrays allow for fast array operations, often implemented in compiled C code, which makes them much faster than native Python lists.\n",
    "- *Broadcasting* - NumPy allows element-wise operations without explicit looping, which makes it ideal for handling large datasets in data science."
